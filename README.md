Code style guide

Linting!
Pay attention to the linter!
Use semicolons
const or let over var
Use require and module.exports in .js files
Use import and export in .jsx files
Put import statements at top
Put the default export at bottom
Consider splitting up any file larger than 100 lines
Name files using lowercase-and-dashes instead of camelCase or PascalCase, except for when the default export is a class, then use PascalCase
Define react components as pure functions (instead of classes) whenever possible
